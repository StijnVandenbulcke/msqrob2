# Implementation of the MSqRob analysis of differentially expressed proteins using the Features infrastructure

The `msqrob2` package ports and modernises the method presented in
[`MSqRob`](https://github.com/statOmics/MSqRob) and
[`MSqRobSum`](https://github.com/statOmics/MSqRobSum) to use the
[`Features`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/Features/articles/Features.html)
class infrastructure.
